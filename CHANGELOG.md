# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [3.1.0] - 2023-08-02
### Added
- Get-ChangelogData now returns an additional `ChangeCount` property on `Unreleased` and `Released` properties. `ChangeCount` contains an integer count of the number of changes in that section. (Note that counts for individual change types in a section are available via `$OutputVariable.SECTION-NAME-HERE.Data.CHANGE-TYPE-HERE.Count` syntax.)

### Changed
- Pester test structure modernized and updated to offer increased coverage and more test cases

### Fixed
- Now documented that AzureDevOps option for Update-Changelog's LinkMode requires default branch be main

## [3.0.1] - 2022-12-12

### Changed

- Get-ChangelogData now always outputs a PSCustomObject for the Unreleased property when there is an Unreleased section header in the changelog. The PSCustomObject property RawData will contain the Unreleased header and any change type headers that exist. The properties Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, and Security will be null if there are no corresponding change type under the Unreleased section header.

### Fixed

- Get-ChangelogData will now return null for the property Unreleased if there are no Unreleased section header in the changelog.

### Added

- New LinkModes 'GitHub' and 'AzureDevOps' on Update-Changelog which remove the need to manually specify a LinkPattern
- New property 'ReleaseNotes' returned by Get-ChangelogData containing a formatted version of the changes from the most recent released version

### Changed

- BREAKING CHANGE: New-Changelog now populates an initial change 'Added: Initial release'. This can be overridden to match previous behavior via the new '-NoInitialChange' parameter
- BREAKING CHANGE: Get-ChangelogData's Output.Unreleased is now null if there are no unreleased changes to match the behavior of Output.Released
- BREAKING CHANGE: Minimum supported PowerShell raised to 5.1 instead of 5.0
- Module structure changed to use dot-sourcing
- Build/test/deploy switched from Azure DevOps to GitHub Actions

### Fixed

- Add-ChangelogData now detects type of newline used in file rather than assuming it matches [System.Environment]::NewLine
- Update-Changelog now detects type of newline used in file rather than assuming it matches [System.Environment]::NewLine
- Get-ChangelogData now detects type of newline used in file rather than assuming it matches [System.Environment]::NewLine
